Stardew Armory is currently a WIP mod that aims to implement many of the weapons and rings from Stardew Valley into minecraft.

**Spice up your exploration and gain greater power with Stardew Armory**
The main goal of this mod is to add many of the weapons and combat items from Stardew Valley into Minecraft. This currently includes all normally obtainable weapons<sub>1</sub>, iridium tools, rings, custom blocks, and more!

**Credit for the items' art goes entirely to ConcernedApe and his game [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/).** If you haven't played Stardew Valley I would highly recommend it :) Also big thanks to [Hasshbrowns](https://www.curseforge.com/members/hasshbrowns/projects) for having the idea to do this in the first place and basically co-authoring the mod.

Feel free to add this mod to your modpack (and if you do, let me know, I'd love to see it); it is suggested in the world options that structures generate and the spawn chest is enabled.

The Adventurer's Guild was built by [peachimarii](https://www.curseforge.com/members/peachimarii/projects).

**I AM WORKING ON THIS MOD ON MY OWN TIME.**

If you have any idea for the mod or would like to help, please leave a comment or pm me. Any feedback is welcome!
